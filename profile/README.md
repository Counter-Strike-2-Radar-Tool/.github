## üß≠ Overview

The **Radar Tool** functions as an independent overlay that visualizes **player positioning, sightlines, and engagement zones**. It‚Äôs not a cheat or wallhack ‚Äî it‚Äôs an advanced visualization platform designed for **training and analysis**.
You can use it in workshop maps, custom demos, or offline scrims to review rotations, visibility timing, and entry routes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Counter-Strike 2 Radar Tool is **VAC-safe** when used offline. It reads telemetry and replay data only ‚Äî no injection or packet modification.
